## 1.1.0

### Breaking

- `Css.hex` raises `Invalid_argument` on a malformed hex string instead of
  returning opaque black; `Css.hex_opt` returns an option. Parsing is
  unaffected (#232)
- `cascade fmt` and `cascade diff` drop `--memtrace`, and the library drops the
  `memtrace` dependency (#237)
- A parse failure that drops every rule makes `cascade fmt` exit 1 instead of
  writing an empty stylesheet with a green status (#273)
- `cascade diff --diff=canonical` exits 1 whenever the two canonical forms
  differ, and prints the difference. It called such a pair equivalent and
  exited 0 when the structural walk reached no difference, which left a missing
  normalisation key and a blind spot in the walk both reading as success.
  ``Css_compare.equal ~mode:`Canonical`` answers on the same bytes, and
  `Css_compare.No_diff` no longer carries the two canonical forms (#290)
- `Tree_diff.t` gains `layer_order`; record expressions must set it and record
  patterns must bind it or use `; _` (#295)
- Optimizer profiling is per run: `Css.optimize` and `Optimize.stylesheet` take
  `?stats:Stats.t` and `Stats.snapshot` reads back an immutable record.
  `Optimize.counters`, `Optimize.pass_times`, `Optimize.iteration_stats` and
  `Optimize.set_profile` are gone, along with the per-pass table and the
  marginal-stop counter, which no pass had written since the DAG scheduler
  replaced the multi-pass fixpoint (#288)
- `Resolve.NODE` gains `text_children`, the data of a node's direct child text
  nodes, which `:empty` needs (#286)
- `Apply.Make(...).compute` takes `~sheet:Stylesheet.t` instead of
  `~css:string`. It parsed the text itself and answered an empty result when
  the parse failed, so a caller could not tell invalid CSS from empty CSS; the
  parse, and the warnings `Css.of_string` collects with it, now stay with the
  caller
- `Apply.result.kept` counts the rules it says it counts. A block at-rule
  counted once for its wrapper, so a `@media` holding three rules reported one (#287)
- `cascade apply` exits 1 when a `<style>` block or the supplementary
  stylesheet parses to nothing, and leaves such a block in the page instead of
  deleting it. It used to delete the block and exit 0, shipping an unstyled
  page under a green status. A supplementary stylesheet that cannot be read is
  an error rather than no stylesheet at all (#287)

### Parsing

- `Reader.peek_utf8_at` returns `None` for negative and out-of-range offsets
  instead of indexing outside the input (#308)
- URL references use RFC 3986 resolution, preserving data, scheme-relative,
  query-only and fragment-only URLs (#304)
- Container conditions parse component values directly, so strings and escaped
  or case-insensitive boolean keywords keep their CSS meaning (#305)
- Media queries parse component values directly, so escaped identifiers and
  balanced general-enclosed values keep their CSS meaning (#306)
- Typed `-webkit-` and `-moz-` aliases use their standard value grammar.
- `shape-outside` reads its whole grammar. Only `none`, `circle()`, a non-empty
  `inset()` and the CSS-wide keywords were accepted, so `margin-box`,
  `circle(50%) content-box`, `url(shape.png)` and every other basic shape were
  rejected and the declaration dropped
- An identifier takes any code point at or above U+0080, so a selector such as
  `.text-↗` parses. `Css.of_string` takes `?enforce_spec` and `cascade` takes
  `--enforce-spec` to restrict identifiers to the CSS Syntax 3 range list;
  output is the same either way (#254)
- Parsed rather than dropped with a warning: `perspective: none`,
  `text-underline-offset: auto` and a negative `text-underline-offset` (#212);
  a nested rule whose selector starts with an identifier, such as
  `h2:where(...)` (#193); and an unrecognised media query such as
  `theme(static)`, kept as never-matching instead of discarding the `@media`
  block or the `@import` (#192)
- The eleven `scroll-margin` properties take a negative length, as CSS Scroll
  Snap 1 allows; only `scroll-padding` is non-negative (#280)
- A `}` ends a declaration value in `Parser.block_contents` instead of being
  swallowed along with the rest of the block, and a bad string serialises back
  to source that reads as one instead of vanishing from an at-rule prelude (#284)

### Printing and nesting

- `background-position` and `mask-position` print one position per layer,
  comma-separated (#209)
- A non-integer above roughly 4.6e10 prints as a number again, not as
  `scale(1.2345678.9012e+19)` (#265)
- An unknown at-rule keeps the space before its prelude under `--minify`;
  `@foo bar {x:1}` printed `@foobar{x:1}`, a different at-rule (#272)
- Flattening distributes the parent over every branch of a nested selector
  list: `.p { a, b { ... } }` is `.p a, .p b` (#205)
- Substituting `&` wraps a complex parent in `:is()`:
  `.a .b { .dark & { ... } }` flattens to `.dark :is(.a .b)` (#194)

### Minification

- `--lossless` preserves logical sizing and corner aliases in source order.
- A hex colour folds to its name whenever the name is no longer, which the
  hand-copied inversion table missed for `bisque`, `indigo`, `orchid`,
  `salmon`, `sienna`, `tomato` and `violet`: `#ffe4c4` stayed hex where
  `#f0ffff` already became `azure` (#289)
- `Css.Values.read_color_name` reads every name `pp_color_name` prints, not 21
  of the 148, and `grey` reads as `Grey` rather than the `Gray` that prints
  `gray` (#289)
- `--lossless` keeps a longhand in source order against the shorthand that
  resets it, whether the property is typed or not; moving the pair changed what
  the rule rendered (#267, #270)
- `--lossless` keeps a colour's alpha exact, like its other channels;
  `oklch(... / .74567)` printed `/.746` (#278)
- `--lossless` keeps a flow-relative property in source order against a
  physical one of the same family, since the writing mode decides which
  physical side it resolves to (#277)
- A vendor-prefixed value repeated with `!important` collapses to the later
  declaration; only a genuine value difference is kept as a legacy fallback.
  `display:-webkit-box;display:-webkit-box!important` survived as both
- A selector list mixing a vendor pseudo-element with ordinary selectors is
  split, so a browser that ignores `::-webkit-search-cancel-button` keeps the
  other selectors' declarations (#203)
- A rule with nested children absorbs a later rule with the same selector when
  the two are disjoint (#203)
- SVG presentation properties are typed and minify like any other value:
  `stop-color:#fff`, `fill-opacity:.1`, `stroke-dashoffset:0`,
  `stroke-dasharray:4 2`, `paint-order: stroke fill markers` to `stroke`, a
  redundant `vector-effect` keyword dropped, and `fill-rule`, `clip-rule`,
  `stroke-linecap` and `stroke-linejoin` read as their own grammars, including
  `miter-clip` and `arcs` (#214, #228, #234, #235, #236, #240, #241, #242)
- More values fold to their exact equivalent: `grid-auto-flow: row dense` to
  `dense` (#230); a zero angle in radians to `0deg`, so `hue-rotate(0rad)`
  folds like the other units (#229); `hue-rotate()` with a zero argument inside
  a custom property (#257); a `font-stretch` keyword to its percentage, except
  in the `font` shorthand (#206); and adjacent gradient stops of one colour to
  a double-position stop, with a `0deg` linear-gradient angle dropped and the
  stops reversed, never for the legacy prefixed gradients (#214)
- `--log=cascade.factor:debug` reports the optimizer's factoring decisions:
  each fixpoint iteration and every segment reverted or skipped (#239)
- `--minify` is faster on a large stylesheet, for the same output (#221)

### Custom properties and `@layer`

- `Css.inline_vars` resolves `var()` across `@layer` boundaries and folds a
  custom property redefined across layers to its cascade winner, so a layered
  stylesheet inlines like its unlayered form (#187, #189)
- `cascade apply` projects rules inside `@layer` onto elements; a fully layered
  stylesheet, such as Tailwind v4 output, inlined nothing (#188)
- `cascade apply` weighs cascade layers instead of ignoring them: an unlayered
  declaration beats a layered one, `!important` reverses that, and a rule with
  no inline form stays inside its layer (#283)
- `cascade apply` leaves a declaration in the stylesheet when a rule inside
  `@scope`, `@starting-style`, `@when`, `@else` or `@-moz-document` sets the
  same property; it moved inline, above the rule that was kept (#286)
- `cascade apply` only inlines a rule whose selector its matcher can represent,
  so `[data-k="X" i]`, a namespaced selector and the `>>>` and `||` combinators
  stay in the stylesheet rather than being inlined onto nobody and dropped, and
  `:empty` counts an element's text: `<p>text</p>` is not empty (#286)
- `Css.vars_of_declarations` reports the `var()` references of 39 properties it
  answered with none, so `Css.resolve_theme` emits the theme binding for
  `inline-size: var(--w)` as it does for `width: var(--w)` (#266)

### Canonical diff

- The projection expands selector-list rules onto their branches (#204), folds
  two conditional blocks sharing a condition (#211), keys `@media not all and
  (X)` as the `@media not (X)` it equals while still emitting what it read
  (#231), and keys a run of `@property` rules by name, keeping the last
  registration (#227)
- It skips the rule-regrouping passes, which depend on input order;
  `Css.optimize` takes `?regroup` to turn them off (#215, #224)
- It normalises the space after a top-level comma in a custom-property value,
  drops a declaration a later rule with the identical selector also writes
  (leaving `!important` alone), and pairs exactly matching rules before falling
  back to the property signature (#206)
- A custom property keeps its `!important`, its layer and its metadata through
  the projection, so the differ no longer calls two sheets that disagree about
  the flag identical (#271)
- It rewrites a quoted multi-word font name in a custom property as the
  `<ident>` sequence it unquotes to, the same family name under CSS Fonts 4
  sec. 15.3: `--font-sans: ui-sans-serif, "Noto Color Emoji"` and
  `--font-sans: ui-sans-serif, Noto Color Emoji` reach one form. The structural
  comparator already folded the two together; the projection did not (#290)
- Under `--lossless` it keys a `color(srgb ...)` whose channels land on whole
  bytes as the `rgb()` spelling of the same colour, so `color(srgb 1 0 0)` and
  `rgb(255 0 0)` stop reading as a difference. Exact conversions only:
  `color(display-p3 1 0 0)` and an off-grid channel stay distinct, and the
  printer still emits the function that was written (#289)

### Diff report

- Grouping repeated selectors and conditions is linear in the number of rules
  while preserving source order (#307)
- The cascade layer order the two sheets declare is compared, and the report
  names the layer pairs that swapped. Dropping an `@layer a;` pin, which makes
  the other layer the weaker one, read as no difference at all
- Every entry the report prints names what it is about. A `@property` or
  `@keyframes` surplus reached the rule level, which has no rule to name and
  printed a bare tree connector while still counting the entry towards the
  summary; `@charset`, `@namespace` and `@layer a, b;` had no name at all
- A container that changed places is reported whether or not its body changed,
  on the same order keys the rule level uses. Three absolute-index distances
  gated it before, so swapping an `@media` with the rule below it - which
  changes which declaration wins above the breakpoint - printed `CSS files are
  identical` and exited 0
- A rule that writes one property more than once, as a fallback chain does, is
  compared occurrence by occurrence; matching by name alone made
  `a{color:red;color:blue}` against `a{color:red;color:green}` report
  `color: blue -> red`, a value neither side holds (#285)
- Containers are compared however deep they nest. The walk stopped at three
  levels, so a leaf difference under five at-rules was reported as no
  difference at all, exit code included (#285)
- A container entry with nothing to show under it reads as `(modified, no
  details)`; it claimed a position change, which only a `Reordered` entry
  establishes (#285)
- A comparison that classified nothing says so: `Changes: none classified
  structurally (see report below)`. It read `No structural differences`, which
  claimed equivalence over a comparison that fell through to a string diff, and
  over a side whose content the parser discarded (#285)
- A canonical-form difference the structural walk did not reach is printed as
  `Canonical forms differ:` above a string diff of the two forms (#290)
- A string diff names the two sides with the labels it was given, so `cascade
  diff` heads it with the two file names instead of `Expected` and `Actual` (#290)
- A declaration reorder that decides the cascade is reported inside `@media`,
  `@layer` and `@supports` (#268), and the at-rules that carry no selector -
  `@page`, `@starting-style`, `@counter-style`, `@scope`, a second
  `@font-face` - are compared on their bodies (#269)
- An `@property` is compared on its whole body and the entry names the
  descriptors that differ (#264); a rule is reported as reordered only when it
  moved against another rule (#263); and the size summary lists the two files
  in the order of the `---` and `+++` headers, so an addition no longer reads
  as a shrink (#261)
- A selector written by more than one rule is reported once, at the top level
  and inside a container; when its declarations survive on both sides, spread
  differently, the entry names the move and counts as a rearranged rule
  (#259, #260)
- Blocks sharing a condition are reconciled one for one, so three `@container`
  blocks against two report the removed block rather than two changed
  containers; the same pairing decides media, layer and supports (#258)
- Every statement of an added or removed container is reported, including a
  nested `@media`, and a container is no longer counted again as a rule
  difference with an empty selector (#253)
- `cascade diff` bounds its report to the deepest level that fits, with
  `--depth` to pin a level or print the tree in full; parse warnings print
  above the report, capped per side; and blocks that only moved are reported as
  a shift run (#210)

### New properties and values

- Complete the logical border properties: `Css.border_block_color` and its
  start/end siblings, the `Css.border_inline_width` and
  `Css.border_block_width` shorthands (type `logical_border_width`), and the
  start/end style longhands such as `Css.border_inline_start_style`
  (#197, #198, #199, #200)
- Add `Css.parse_font_family`, `Css.parse_list_style_type` and
  `Css.parse_list_style_image`, the single-value readers behind the `font` and
  `list-style` shorthands (#201, #202)
- Add `Css.Values.oklch_none_hue` for an achromatic colour with a missing hue,
  printed as `oklch(55.6% 0 none)` (#190)

### Testing

- CI rejects merlint findings and incomplete library record patterns (#310)
- `dune test` renders a stylesheet and its optimized forms in a headless
  browser and compares the computed style of every element, on a document
  derived from the stylesheet's own selectors; it skips where no browser is
  installed (#275)

## 1.0.0

First public release. Cascade was extracted from the [tw](https://github.com/samoht/tw)
(Tailwind CSS v4 in OCaml) project as a standalone CSS command-line tool and
library, then stabilised over several internal milestones.

### Library

- Typed CSS AST: selectors, declarations, values, statements, and
  stylesheets are sealed ADTs. Invalid constructions are caught at compile
  time.
- Single warning-aware parse entry point:
  - `Css.of_string` runs CSS Syntax Level 3 recovery and returns
    `(parse, Error.t) result`, where `parse = { stylesheet; warnings }`.
  - `~strict:true` promotes the first warning to `Error _`.
  - `Css.of_string_exn` returns the recovered stylesheet directly and raises
    `Error.Parse_error` on `Error`.
- Pretty-printer with separate pretty and minified contexts
  (`Css.to_string ?minify`), with several typed printers exposed
  (`pp_color`, `pp_length`, ...).
- Structural transforms (`fold`, `map`, `sort`, `flatten_nesting`,
  `inline_imports`) and structural CSS diff utilities via the
  `cascade.diff` sub-library.
- Optimizer with deduplication, rule merging, selector combining, and
  shorthand/longhand coverage including `all` reset folding. Rule merging is
  order-independent: rules are scheduled through a conflict DAG so cascade-safe
  reorderings converge on the same output regardless of source order.
- Minification optimises estimated compressed (gzip) transfer size by default:
  a global factoring that shrinks raw bytes but would grow the compressed
  output is not applied. Pass `~objective:\`Raw` (CLI `--objective=raw`) to
  optimise raw bytes instead, for output that ships uncompressed.
- Spec coverage:
  - Selectors Level 4 -- including `:has()`, `:is()`, `:where()`, `:not()`,
    nesting `&`, and full attribute syntax.
  - Values & Units Level 4 -- `calc()`, `clamp()`, `min()`, `max()`,
    `minmax()`, the modern length units, durations, angles.
  - Color Level 4 -- 15 colour spaces including `oklch()`, `oklab()`,
    `lch()`, `hwb()`, `color-mix()`, plus the 148 named colours.
  - Conditional Rules Level 3-5 -- `@media`, `@supports`, `@container`
    (including typed `style()`/`scroll-state()` queries with range
    operators), `@when` / `@else`.
  - Cascade Level 5 -- `@layer` declarations and blocks, CSS-wide
    keywords, and `all` reset semantics in the optimizer.
  - Custom Properties Level 1 -- `var()` parsing/printing, typed
    fallbacks, theme/default substitution, `@property` registration.
  - Fonts Level 4 (`@font-face` descriptors), Animations Level 1
    (`@keyframes`, `@starting-style`).
- Over 400 typed properties cover box model, flexbox, grid (including
  `grid-template-areas` validation), logical properties, typography
  (`font-variant-*`, `text-emphasis-*`, `text-decoration-skip-*`,
  `initial-letter*`), borders and `border-image`, backgrounds and
  gradients, transforms (`translate`, `scale`, `rotate`, `transform`),
  transitions, animations (`animation-range*`, scroll-driven timelines),
  filters, masks, scroll snap, anchor positioning (`position-anchor`,
  `position-area`, `position-try-fallbacks`), view transitions, and the
  common vendor-prefixed properties.
- Custom-property workflows: typed `<syntax>` parsing for `@property`,
  registered-property substitution against an explicit `Css.Context.t`,
  and round-trip-stable `var()` serialisation with literal fallbacks.

### CLI tools

- CLI commands share one binary file reader that closes its descriptor when a
  read fails (#309)
- `cascade` -- pretty-print and minify CSS files. It accepts stdin via `-`
  or a missing file argument, and writes output to stdout.
- `cascade --minify` applies the standard safe transforms, including
  deduplication, rule merging, selector grouping, empty-rule elimination, and
  nested-rule flattening, optimising estimated gzip transfer size by default
  (`--objective=raw` optimises raw bytes instead).
- `cascade --inline-imports` resolves local `@import` rules relative to the
  input file, and `cascade --inline-vars` substitutes static custom-property
  references. `--keep-vars=NAMES` preserves selected custom properties.
- `cascade diff` provides structural CSS diffing between two files with
  `auto`, `tree`, `string`, and `canonical` modes; respects `NO_COLOR`,
  `CASCADE_COLOR`, and `--color`, and colours only when stdout is a tty.
  Identical files exit 0 and differing files exit 1, so the command slots
  into CI checks and git hooks. The `canonical` mode projects both sheets to a normal form
  first, so equivalent factorings -- different rule grouping, cascade-safe rule
  and declaration order -- compare identical rather than as spurious changes.
- The CLI is installable as a binary through the Homebrew tap
  `samoht/tap/cascade`, with opam installation still available for OCaml users.

### Notes

- `cascade` parses already-decoded UTF-8 strings. The CSS Syntax Level 3
  byte-stream decoding step (BOM handling, `@charset` byte sniffing,
  HTTP/environment charset fallback) is the caller's responsibility.
- CSS nesting round-trips through the parser and printer, and the minifier
  flattens nested rules when safe.
- `@import` rules are preserved by default. Use `--inline-imports` for
  explicit closed-world filesystem inlining.
- No source-map support.
