(** Canonical cascade-safe rule ordering: project each run of reorderable
    statements through {!Rule_graph} to its canonical linear extension. *)

open Stylesheet

(* A run element is a plain style rule with no nested block, or a conditional
   at-rule block ([@media] / [@supports] / [@container]) whose transitive
   content is itself only such elements. The block moves atomically; its
   contained rules supply the conflict footprint. Custom-property declarations
   are reorderable too: the dependency graph keys each custom property by name,
   so two writers of the same property on overlapping selectors keep their
   order, while a [var()] reader - which writes its own property, not the one it
   reads - moves freely past the definition. A named [@layer] block or [@layer]
   declaration pins the layer order at its first occurrence, so it stays a
   barrier, as does everything else. *)

(* The graph node standing for one element. A block collapses to a single
   pseudo-rule holding every contained selector branch and declaration: its edge
   set is the cross product, a superset of the true per-rule edges, so conflict
   detection stays conservative while the block reorders as one unit. The
   applicability condition itself is irrelevant to safety: whether or not the
   condition holds, a swap with a non-conflicting neighbour cannot change any
   computed value. *)

   element's relative selectors against it so overlap is computed on the
   effective selector. *)
